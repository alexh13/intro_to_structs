# intro_to_structs
Rewrote my most recent high scores program so that each name/score pair is stored in a struct named highscore.
The program asks the user to enter the amount of scores, then asks for the name and the score of each player in 
the original amount entered. Once that data is collected the program executes and returns the list of scores from 
highest to lowest.

What I Learned:
-Solve problems using structs in accordance with good programming practice.
